# Strategic Bitcoin Asset Reserves 🔹(SBAR)🔹

**Developed by Mildly Savage Digital LLC**

SBAR is a transparent, decentralized dashboard showcasing Bitcoin reserves strategically assigned to high-value personal assets—such as homes, land, vehicles, collectibles, and precious metals.

---

## 🔎 Purpose

This dashboard provides a live snapshot of Bitcoin holdings backing non-business assets for valuation, growth analysis, and trustless verification. It aligns with Bitcoin’s principles of transparency, independence, and digital permanence.

SBAR allows asset owners to demonstrate credibility, track month-to-month BTC growth, and prepare for future trade or sale opportunities backed by a verifiable digital reserve.

---

## 📊 Live Dashboard Features

- ✅ Real-time Bitcoin price via CoinGecko API
- ✅ Current and previous BTC reserve holdings
- ✅ Month-to-month growth percentage calculator
- ✅ Block height sync and timestamp
- ✅ Linked verification of reserve deposit transaction
- ✅ Public BTC vault address display

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

SBAR data is displayed using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS:

- `index.html`: Structurally organizes reserve information and branding
- `script.js`: Fetches Bitcoin price, block height, and calculates growth
- `style.css`: Applies SBAR-themed design (dark blue-purple background and Orbitron font)

All data is dynamically refreshed and can be modified to integrate real Bitcoin wallets, asset registries, or fee models in future development phases.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Interactive asset cards with BTC-backed valuations
- Buyer/seller fee negotiation module
- Integration with Termux wallet or Bitcoin Core node
- GitHub pages deployment or mobile-friendly UI
- SBAR ecosystem explorer for collectibles, land, and estate items
